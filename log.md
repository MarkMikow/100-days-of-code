# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Find the Longest Word in a String", "Title Case a Sentence", and "Return Largest Numbers in Arrays" from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts:** I have been coding everyday, though this past week has been spent doing tutorials on the ipad app "Learn JS" (I've been traveling with my ipad (no laptop, currently, only imac at home)) or doing Javascript Programming Challenges on https://iokungfoo.net/.

Today I joined 100DaysOfCode and created a twitter account to publicly keep track of my progress (along with this log in my GitHub account). 

When I do the fCC challenges, I have an idea in my head as to how to write the code. I write out what I know, but I always get stuck with certain details. I then search on google and, as a last resort, I look at fCC's forums to find the missing pieces. They never match exactly what I have written, but I get the ideas of what I need to do in order to complete my code. I have yet to solve one challenge 100% on my own with no help, but I am getting better at searching. 

I am calling my version of 100DaysOfCode 100DaysOfFreeCodeCamp. The reason for this is twofold:
1. I have a tendency to do more of the same (i.e. do more challenges or tutorials on other sites), thus moving more horizontally through the curriculum than vertically.
2. I want to earn and claim my Front End Development Certificate from freeCodeCamp!
