# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Find the Longest Word in a String", "Title Case a Sentence", and "Return Largest Numbers in Arrays" from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts:** I have been coding everyday, though this past week has been spent doing tutorials on the ipad app "Learn JS" (I've been traveling with my ipad (no laptop, currently, only imac at home)) or doing Javascript Programming Challenges on https://iokungfoo.net/.

Today I joined 100DaysOfCode and created a twitter account to publicly keep track of my progress (along with this log in my GitHub account). 

When I do the fCC challenges, I have an idea in my head as to how to write the code. I write out what I know, but I always get stuck with certain details. I then search on google and, as a last resort, I look at fCC's forums to find the missing pieces. They never match exactly what I have written, but I get the ideas of what I need to do in order to complete my code. I have yet to solve one challenge 100% on my own with no help, but I am getting better at searching. 

I am calling my version of 100DaysOfCode 100DaysOfFreeCodeCamp. The reason for this is twofold:
1. I have a tendency to do more of the same (i.e. do more challenges or tutorials on other sites), thus moving more horizontally through the curriculum than vertically.
2. I want to earn and claim my Front End Development Certificate from freeCodeCamp!

### Day 1: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Confirm the Ending" from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting. Also started on creating a website for doing AP-style Calculus problems. I originally wanted to learn computer programming in order to build an App to help students be able to practice AP-style Calculus questions. Today, it has started!

**Thoughts**: I have been practicing a lot recently doing javascript challenges and have not been spending any time doing any HTML and CSS. While learning javascript, I want to continue to practice what I've learned (and learn more!) about HTML and CSS. Thus, I started my Learn Calculus website and can continue building it as I'm learning javascript et al.

2) continue with Calculus Website


### Day 2: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Repeat a string, Truncate a string, Chunky Monkey, Slasher Flick, and Mutations from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

I also started "Watch and Code" and completed Version 1 - Arrays.

**Thoughts** I am getting better (and faster) at solving the algorithms!

The goal of the "Watch and Code" tutorial is to build a "Todo App" solely using JavaScript. I will implement what I learn into my Calculus website.

1) Continue with fcc's algorithms. Goal for tomorrow is to complete the last 4 of Basic Scripting.
2) Continue with "Watch and Code"
3) Continue with Calculus website.


### Day 3: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent 1 1/2 hours playing around with HTML and CSS on my website.  

**Thoughts** I spent most of my time today organizing material for this upcoming year's Calculus class (which doesn't count towards coding, but needs to be done everyday). Not only will the calculus material be organized for school, but this organization will be used for the website.

1) Continue with fcc's algorithms. Goal for tomorrow is to complete the last 4 of Basic Scripting.
2) Continue with "Watch and Code"


### Day 4: 

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Version 2 - Functions of "Watch and Code."
I also did "Falsey Bouncer", "Seek and Destroy", and "Where Do I Belong" of freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts** I learned about the Boolean argument. I could do most of each of the codes, but I searched for help in order to complete them. I did "Where Do I Belong" on my own in way that was completely different than all the examples by others.

I also learned that I can write code in Sublime, then copy and paste it into google chrome browser to play with it!

Limited time tomorrow. I would like to complete "Caesar's Cipher", which is the last Basic Algorithm to Script in freeCodeCamp. Also, continue with Watch and Code.
