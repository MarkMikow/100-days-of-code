# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Find the Longest Word in a String", "Title Case a Sentence", and "Return Largest Numbers in Arrays" from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts:** I have been coding everyday, though this past week has been spent doing tutorials on the ipad app "Learn JS" (I've been traveling with my ipad (no laptop, currently, only imac at home)) or doing Javascript Programming Challenges on https://iokungfoo.net/.

Today I joined 100DaysOfCode and created a twitter account to publicly keep track of my progress (along with this log in my GitHub account). 

When I do the fCC challenges, I have an idea in my head as to how to write the code. I write out what I know, but I always get stuck with certain details. I then search on google and, as a last resort, I look at fCC's forums to find the missing pieces. They never match exactly what I have written, but I get the ideas of what I need to do in order to complete my code. I have yet to solve one challenge 100% on my own with no help, but I am getting better at searching. 

I am calling my version of 100DaysOfCode 100DaysOfFreeCodeCamp. The reason for this is twofold:
1. I have a tendency to do more of the same (i.e. do more challenges or tutorials on other sites), thus moving more horizontally through the curriculum than vertically.
2. I want to earn and claim my Front End Development Certificate from freeCodeCamp!

### Day 1: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Confirm the Ending" from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting. Also started on creating a website for doing AP-style Calculus problems. I originally wanted to learn computer programming in order to build an App to help students be able to practice AP-style Calculus questions. Today, it has started!

**Thoughts**: I have been practicing a lot recently doing javascript challenges and have not been spending any time doing any HTML and CSS. While learning javascript, I want to continue to practice what I've learned (and learn more!) about HTML and CSS. Thus, I started my Learn Calculus website and can continue building it as I'm learning javascript et al.

1) https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/repeat-a-string-repeat-a-string
2) continue with Calculus Website


### Day 2: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Repeat a string, Truncate a string, Chunky Monkey, Slasher Flick, and Mutations from freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

I also started "Watch and Code" and completed Version 1 - Arrays.

**Thoughts** I am getting better (and faster) at solving the algorithms!

The goal of the "Watch and Code" tutorial is to build a "Todo App" solely using JavaScript. I will implement what I learn into my Calculus website.

**Link(s) to work**
1) Continue with fcc's algorithms. Goal for tomorrow is to complete the last 4 of Basic Scripting.
2) Continue with "Watch and Code"
3) Continue with Calculus website.


### Day 3: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent 1 1/2 hours playing around with HTML and CSS on my website.  

**Thoughts** I spent most of my time today organizing material for this upcoming year's Calculus class (which doesn't count towards coding, but needs to be done everyday). Not only will the calculus material be organized for school, but this organization will be used for the website.

**Link(s) to work**
1) Continue with fcc's algorithms. Goal for tomorrow is to complete the last 4 of Basic Scripting.
2) Continue with "Watch and Code"


### Day 4: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Version 2 - Functions of "Watch and Code."
I also did "Falsey Bouncer", "Seek and Destroy", and "Where Do I Belong" of freeCodeCamp's Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts** I learned about the Boolean argument. I could do most of each of the codes, but I searched for help in order to complete them. I did "Where Do I Belong" on my own in way that was completely different than all the examples by others.

I also learned that I can write code in Sublime, then copy and paste it into google chrome browser to play with it!

**Link(s) to work**
Limited time tomorrow. I would like to complete "Caesar's Cipher", which is the last Basic Algorithm to Script in freeCodeCamp. Also, continue with Watch and Code.


### Day 5: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did Version 2 - Functions on "Watch and Code". Also worked on my Calculus website.

**Thoughts** Limited time today (only an hour!), but I got my coding done!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 6: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Caesars Cipher" completely on my own! Also completed the JSON APIs and Ajax section on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Next up on freeCodeCamp is "Build a Random Quote Machine" - the first of the Intermediate Front End Development Projects.

School is going to start real soon! What I need to concentrate on:
1) Learning more about using GitHub - making commits, pull requests, etc.
2) Calculus Website - Derivatives questions with check boxes for multiple choice questions.
3) Learning Latex and MathJax to put math equations on Calculus website.
4) Continuing with freeCodeCamp!

### Day 7: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a random quote machine - the first of freeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front End Development Projects. Very slow going!

**Thoughts** I am going to use what I learn on the project for my Calculus Website. Specifically, generating random questions for each topic.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 8: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Looked at other random quote machines on CodePen and did a little reverse-engineering, trying to understand how JavaScript works.

**Thoughts** Lots of time spent looking at other people's code and trying to understand it, then applying a little and changing the code to fit my needs.
I seem to learn coding by looking at other code, then changing it for what I want. After doing this a few times, I am able to then do it on my own - but it takes a while! At first I thought that I was "cheating" but I'm not actually copying the exact code. When I want to create something, I look at similar creations to see how it's done, then after reading through the code, apply what (little) I understand and manipulate it to fit my needs.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 9: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the morning creating a webpage "Shapes" where I played around a lot, learning how to put div boxes within boxes.

**Thoughts** I need to really understand how to put boxes inside of boxes - this helped tremendously and I can use my own work as a template for the future.

**Link(s) to work**
I put a link on CodePen, where the triangle shows up on my computer, but not my phone.
https://codepen.io/markmikow/pen/oexBpZ
I also made a github repository for it and later added a change using the GUI.
I need to learn how to use GitHub via the command line!


### Day 10: August 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours playing with box sizes using px, em, and % in order to have the png image of the Lucky Buddha on the left hand side of the page. 

**Thoughts** 
1) Spent way to much time on this, though I did learn through experimenting!
2) The "Shapes" webpage I made yesterday didn't show up the same on CodePen as it did on my web browser. Specifically, on an iphone, the red triangle showed up as a red square.
NOTE: look into this later!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 11: August 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Lucky Buddha Quote Generator, apart from installing the twitter icon. 

**Thoughts** I pretty much spent the entire day on this, because the quotes were not showing up. I kept looking at other people's codes and implementing them on my page, but they still didn't work. Finally, I started from scratch by watching a Coding Tutorial's 360 video (3-part) on youtube. I immeditately saw my mistake in the very first line of my script.js. 
Instead of:

$(document).ready(function() {

I had:

$(document).ready(function()) {

That one extra ) which I hadn't noticed literally caused me hours of not getting the code to work. However, by starting over, I saw where the mistake was! Everything else took little time to complete.

However, once again, the page shows differently when I run the code directly into my browser than when I run it in CodePen (I copy and pasted my code into CodePen). Sometimes, when running it on CodePen, the floral background scene would not appear - the background was completely white. Othertimes, it showed up.

What I am finding is that I want to learn JavaScript better. I am kind of flailing about and I am spending way too much time in my learning process! The Coding Tutorial 360's videos are great and to the point, and take very little time to complete the projects. 

On someone's twitter feed last night (I am writing this on Aug. 3), they stated that they are starting JavaScript 30, so I checked it out and signed up. 30 days of 30 Javascript projects. I am hoping to really get some experience under my belt and understand how to use JavaScript better!

### Day 12: August 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
1) Learned to create folders on my desktop using the terminal and to move files into the folder via the terminal.
2) I learned how to add, commit, remote add origin, and push all the "luckyBuddha" files (my "quote machine") onto my GitHub repository via the terminal. This is the first time that I have ever done this!
3) Added the Tweet button to the "Lucky Buddha Quote Generator" (with the help, once again, of Coding Tutorial 360).

**Thoughts** Still can't get the quote machine to look right on my iphone. 

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 13: August 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a "Simple Javascript Quiz" with Udemy's "Projects in JavaScript & JQuery."

**Thoughts** What I've learned today:
1) Write out HTML first, then style it with CSS.
2) My code did not work! After searching through the help forum, I found this:
https://codepen.io/RussEby/pen/QwpeEL
I adjusted my code, but it still didn't work!! So, I copied Russ' code onto a different set of files and it worked. Therefore, there is some mistake somewhere in my code because it should be identical to his. Tomorrow I will go through both codes, line-by-line, and find where I went wrong!
3) Some of this (the HTML & CSS) was review - good! and some was new. I really like to follow along, and then try coding on my own. I am going to make a simple math quiz project on my own tomorrow!
4) I checked out JavaScript 30 and it was way over my head - so I am doing the Udemy course instead.
5) I want to clean up my luckyBuddha app.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 14: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started front page of Calculus App from scratch.

**Thoughts** Today was so much fun! I am so grateful to have found freeCodeCamp just two months ago!

**Link(s) to work**
https://codepen.io/markmikow/pen/yogOze


### Day 15: August 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
0) Learned how to create a folder with a space in the name, via the terminal: mkdir Lucky\ Buddha. Also made html, css, & JS files via the terminal (all for today's "Basic Calculator" project).
1) Built "Basic Calculator" with Udemy's "17 Complete JavaScript Projects Explained Step-by-Step."
2) Redesigned "Calculus Conqueror" page, added two buttons, tied in JavaScript to the "Next" button.

**Thoughts** 
0) I want to use the terminal as much as possible. I could not get the "Basic Calculator" files to open in sublime via the terminal. I need to get that fixed! This is where I left off of the Udacity Git/GitHub program. At some point, after I get this fixed, I will finish that!
1) This project was easy, but I liked it because it explained things step by step (as the title states!). I want to use it as a basis to design an iphone-type basic calculator on my own. I want to do as many of these little "mini" projects as I can so that I can reference them later when I am building apps on my own.
2) I can "play" for hours, like I did today, with the design of a page. This helps me to get more familiar with, and deepen my understanding of, how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work. I seem to spend a lot of time placing "boxes" in different positions. There is so much to learn!

### Day 16: August 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today was a great day! I was able to add 10 questions and access them at random.
Also, I created a github pages website! I learned a lot about git and github today!

**Thoughts** Lots of work to do, such as not repeating questions and installing multiple choice answers.

### Day 17: August 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Very little accomplished today in roughly four hours work. I attemted to install buttons and was unsuccessful.

**Thoughts** I have the day off tomorrow, so I can do some more research. At the end of today I found an article on Sitepoint titled "How to Make a Simple JavaScript Quiz." I will read through that in the morning and see how I can adapt it to what I've got.
I need to redo the questions so that each question contains four choices for answers (A, B, C, & D). Then I can have 4 radio buttons below (labeled A, B, C, & D) which correspond to the answers. In this way, the radio buttons will always contain the same four answers.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 18: August 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Redesigned home page and added a "Limits & Continuity" page. Redid all the questions (not code), added new questions, and put them on the site.

**Thoughts** I am very happy with the way the website looks! I am not concerned about how it looks on a phone - it is (currently) designed for a website. Redesigning the home page and adding a separate page for limits questions gave me the opportunity to practice basic HTML and CSS coding. Much needed and great fun!

### Day 19: August 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I fixed a number of mistakes that were on the website and pointed out to me by a student. They weren't coding mistakes, but I needed to change the code the display the corrections. 

**Thoughts** I started back, full-time, at school today so I am not going to have the luxury of being able to code during the daytime, as I have had this past summer. What I am going to count towards the fulfillment of 100DaysofCode is that I spend at least one hour a day working on the website, github, or some other small project, like those in the Udemy JS course. My main intention is to develop the website along side where the students are at in class.

### Day 20: August 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Woke up at 3 am, excited to put easter eggs in my website! Got up, put them in, then cleaned up code a bit.

**Thoughts** I want to put an easter egg on every page of Calculus Conqueror.

### Day 21: August 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent a couple hours attempting to put an alert page, which stated whether the submitted answer was correct or not. I was able to put the radio buttons on, but not able to tie it into the javascript.

**Thoughts** I posted on Twitter that I need help with JavaScript. Alexander Kallaway replied that codewars.com has been really great for him. I did a few katas last year using Python, so I got back on this afternoon and did a kata with JavaScript. It took me an hour, but I learned a lot!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 22: August 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on katas (levels 8 & 7 kyu's) at Codewars. Great practice for me!

**Thoughts** This is good practice for me - I get real close, but I have to search in order to fully complete each kata. Getting better at searching!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 23: August 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got up at 3:45 am and did an hour of katas at CodeWars before going to school.

**Thoughts** My ideal day would be like today:
3:45am - Rise & shine!
4-5am - Yoga & Meditation
5-6am - Coding
6-7am - Shower & Breakfast
7am - Leave for school / work

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 24: August 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just able to get in an hour at CodeWars. 

**Thoughts** Did 2 katas in the hour. One was easy & one was difficult. With school starting, it's a little more difficult to find time to code :(  I miss these past weeks where I could stay at home and code at my convenience. I was spoiled!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 25: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did an hour of jQuery exercises at Codecademy.

**Thoughts** Although working through the katas at CodeWars has been good, it's not really helping me to be able to tie in the radio buttons to the javascript. Maybe I need to learn jQuery, which is why I switched over to Codecademy today.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 26: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I updated my personal portfolio page for 30 Days 30 Sites.

**Thoughts** I signed up for 30 Days 30 Sites a week ago and haven't done anything. This morning I received an email from them asking how it was going. I thought that they might drop me since I haven't done anything with them, so I worked on my portfolio (for about 3 hours) that I did for freeCodeCamp, and updated it.

**Link(s) to work** https://codepen.io/markmikow/pen/MvrJaX


### Day 27: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with jQuery exercises at Codecademy.

**Thoughts** I was able to get in my hour of coding at school today during my prep period!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 28: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Coded along with some videos for making a quiz app.

**Thoughts** For my calculus app, I need to:
1) tie in the radio buttons
2) add "Definition of Derivative" topic and questions
3) move all the questions to a back-end data bank.

I spent an hour coding along with a video on youtube, but the video was lacking certain information to complete the app. I then found another video and watched it - I think it will work. It will work for the user to text in the answer. I will code tomorrow with the intention of adjusting what I learn from the video, so that the app will work with radio buttons.

**Link(s) to work** This is the link to the video I will use for help:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiAEq9zOpHQ&t=413s


### Day 29: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Very little! 

**Thoughts** I spent hours today reading tutorials and watching videos on making a quiz app and tying in radio buttons. There are so many ways to make an app, though none of the examples I read or saw was like what I am trying to do. At the very end I was able to make an alert box appear. I need to have it state whether the question was answered correctly or not, which will be my next step, using only one question (rather than multiple random ones). One step at a time!

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 30: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on attempting to install radio buttons, but with no success! 

**Thoughts** I got up at 3 this morning, so was able to get in about an hour and a half of coding before school.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 31: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: BREAKTHROUGH! Was finally able to install radio buttons while coding before school. After I got off work, I was able to get the radio buttons to reset when a new question is called.

**Thoughts** I have spent around a week trying to get radio buttons on my web app. Today I finally did it! It has taken a bit of time, but I have learned so much about javascript and jQuery. I also am aware that I have a ton more to learn!
At some point, I am going to need to go through my javascript file because there is much repeated code. The app is working, so I am leaving it be, but I need to learn how to make it functions with less code.
Also, I need to style the alert windows, so that they look much "cooler" than they currently do.

### Day 32: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed the javascript alert boxes to Sweet Alert boxes for when the user gets the correct answer.

**Thoughts** This was easy to do, yet every tutorial I read left things out. If I were a more experienced programmer, I think I would have been able to fill in the missing pieces. However, I'm still a beginner and it took reading tutorials and watching youtube videos to put together the missing pieces. Once I got it, it took only a couple minutes to make a Sweet Alert box. But it took me over an hour to get it.

### Day 33: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent around an hour fixin mistakes I had made in the app. This involved redoing math problems, redoing the code, and doing the whole git process to update the website.

**Thoughts** Yikes! I made a lot of mistakes in the math! But I'm taking the attitude to sift through the math, find the mistakes and fix them, just like I would when I make mistakes in coding. However, I need to be more careful in the future with each new topic.

### Day 34: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.

**Thoughts** I didn't have anything to do on my website today, because I haven't yet writtent the Definition of the Derivative questions to post on it. Therefore, I started Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy to do when I don't have anything to do on my website.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 35: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added Definition of Derivative page to the website.

**Thoughts** HOWEVER! The Limits & Continuity questions now load the wrong answers as the correct ones, so I have temporarily taken them off.

**Link(s) to work**
https://markmikow.github.io

### Day 36: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the Limits & Continuity bug - simply put, I was calling different functions (for Limits & Continuity questions and for Definition of the Derivative questions) by the same name. Once I realized this, I went through and changed various names, such as "answersA" for Limit answers and "answersB" for Def of Der answers. It still didn't completely work. I finally created two javascript pages - one for limits.html and one for defOfDer.html. I don't know if you're really supposed to do this, but it worked perfectly!
Later in the day, I added a bootstrap navbar on top to navigate to previous and next topics.
I also added a "dummy" page for the next topic (Basic Derivatives).

**Thoughts** I learned a lot today about calling functions. I'm glad I made yesterday's mistake - I learn alot by making mistakes, then googling how to fix them, and then fix them!
When I get finished with creating this version of the website, I need to go through the code, line-by-line, and clean it up!
